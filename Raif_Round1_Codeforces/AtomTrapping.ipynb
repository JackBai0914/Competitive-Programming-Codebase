    "Most of this course is devoted to introducing you to classical mechanics in its Newtonian and Lagrangian formulations. Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects. It is a subject that was primarily developed during the 17th and 18th centuries. Microscopic objects like electrons and atoms obey a different set of laws captured in the “quantum mechanics” developed in the early 20th century. In quantum mechanics, microscopic objects can exhibit wave-like phenomena like “superposition” and “interference”. You’ll understand the meanings of these words when we discuss classical waves in the last two weeks of this course and can get a first exposure to the quantum world by taking PHY 208. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although atoms are more complex than fundamental particles like electrons, they are in many ways easier to probe and manipulate. Lasers can be used to apply forces on atoms to cool and trap them. Cooling particles means slowing down their random thermal motion. When atoms are cold enough (typically at microkelvin temperatures), their wave-like character becomes important and an atomic gas can exhibit quantum mechanical phenomena. Cold atoms can also be trapped, i.e. held in place using electromagnetic fields. These trapped atoms can be used for many exciting applications including building ridiculously fast computers (quantum computers) or super accurate atomic clocks important for global navigation satellite systems. \n",

    "While you won’t be able to analyze the behavior of such systems at ultracold temperatures until you take a course in quantum mechanics, you can already understand much of the higher temperature physics related to laser cooling and trapping since it mostly classical.

    "Lithium is an alkali atom with a single “valence” electron (an electron in its outer shell). In quantum mechanics, the energy of this electron is quantized, meaning it can only take certain values corresponding to the different orbital states this electron can occupy. In the lowest energy configuration (the ground state), the valence electron occupies the “2s” orbital, but the laser can induce transitions of this electron a higher energy “2p” orbital. This happens when an atom absorbs a bundle of energy known as a photon from the laser beam. The photon carries an energy  $hc/λ$ and a momentum $h/λ$ directed along the direction of propagation of the laser beam. Here h is a fundamental constant of nature known as Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light and $λ$ is the wavelength of the laser light used to induce the transition, in this case 671 nm. The corresponding frequency of the light is given by $f=c/λ$.\n",

    "Laser cooling works by bombarding an atom with a stream of photons to slow it down. Each time an atom absorbs a photon, it makes a transition from 2s to 2p and the momentum of the photon is transferred to the atom. A few hundred nanoseconds later, the electron undergoes a spontaneous emission event where it decays back to the ground state and reemits the photon in a random direction. Over hundreds of absorption and emission events, the momentum due to the emitted photon averages to zero while the momenta of the absorbed photons add up and decelerate the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing might worry you in this story. What stops an atom from absorbing too many photons and speeding up in the opposite direction? To answer that, let’s go into a bit more detail. Atoms are very picky about the frequency of the photons they absorb. A simple classical model of a lithium atom consists of a valence electron attached to the nucleus with a spring (corresponding to the Coulomb force between them). The spring is taken to have zero equilibrium length. The laser’s electric field shakes the electron and as you learned from mass-spring systems, the response is only strong near resonance. Similarly, in the quantum picture, the electron’s probability to make the transition between 2s and 2p is only large if the energy of photon matches the resonance condition, i.e. it is close to the energy separation between the levels."

    "The second concept we need to recall is the Doppler effect. You might remember that an observer (in this case the atom) moving opposite to the direction of the wave will see its frequency shifted up, while an observer moving in the direction of the wave will see its frequency shifted down. Since the speed of the atoms is small compared to the speed of light, the magnitude of the shift can be approximated by $\\Delta f=v/\\lambda$ and corresponds to hundreds of MHz for atoms moving at thermal speeds (verify that!), i.e. it is large compared to the linewidth. Thus, to cool atoms with typical speeds coming out of the oven, one has to detune the laser frequency below the transition frequency for stationary atoms. For atoms with a certain velocity, the light will then appear on resonance. As you see, the Doppler effect ensures that only atoms moving towards the beam will experience a force due to the light."

The Zeeman slower solves this problem by introducing a magnetic field that keeps the light on resonance as the velocity of the atoms is reduced. The magnetic field tunes the energy splitting between the 2s and 2p levels due to an effect known as the Zeeman effect.

One example of such a trap is the optical dipole trap created by focusing a laser beam. When the beam is very tightly focused so that it only traps at most a few atoms, such a trap is commonly referred to as an optical tweezer. The figure below is an optical image of atoms in a partially filled array of optical tweezers created in Jeff Thompson’s group in the EE department (see Physical Review Letters 122, 143002 (2019)). Each dot you see corresponds to the light scattered by a single $^{171}Yb$ atom and the tweezers are separated by a few micrometers . The goal of the experiment is to use the atoms for quantum computing. The Cheuk group does similar work with arrays of CaF molecules.

    "(b) Obtain the probability of survival of the atom at each modulation frequency and make a plot of the data. Include errorbars for the data points and explain how you obtained them. You might find <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar.html\">plt.errorbar()</a> useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Fit Lorentzian curves to the data to extract the axial and radial frequencies of the tweezer. Report the results of the fit for the trapping frequencies and the fit errors in these quantities. Remember that the atom loss occurs at a driving frequency that is twice the trapping frequency. Also remember that the frequencies you extract from the experiment are measured in Hz, while the angular frequencies you derived in the previous part are in rad/s.  You might find scipy's <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html\">curve_fit</a> useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "(d) You should see that the Lorentzian fit used for extracting the radial trapping frequency is not so good. In fact, the data seems to indicate the presence of two peaks. Why do you think that might be? Ignore this subtlety for the rest of your data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Find a way to extract the waist of the tweezer only using the measured axial and radial trapping frequencies. Use error propagation to obtain a statistical error on the extracted value of the waist. Note that the wavelength of the light used to create the tweezer is 830 nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Next extract a value for the waist using a different method using the radial trapping frequency and the measured power, but not the axial frequency. Again obtain a statistical error on the waist. This method has a large potential systematic error. Based on the video, what is that? Is the value of the waist extracted with this method larger or smaller than the value from part (e)? Does that make sense?\n",
